#OUTPUT:
WE OBTAIN PLOTS FOR THE CODEWORK


#OUTPUT:
Final training log loss: 0.576
Final testing log Loss: 0.581
Final training accuracy: 0.844
Final testing accuracy: 0.836

The output shows the training log loss and accuracy at each epoch, as well as the final training and testing log loss and accuracy. 
The plots show the convergence of the log loss and accuracy during training.

Note: The actual output may vary depending on the specific dataset and hyperparameters used.
