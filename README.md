**Neural Network Model for Binary Classification**

Description:
This repository contains a Python implementation of a neural network model for binary classification using TensorFlow. The model is trained on a dataset and evaluates its performance on a test set.

Files:
model.py: Contains the implementation of the neural network model using TensorFlow.
train.py: Trains the model on the dataset and evaluates its performance on the test set.
requirements.txt: Lists the dependencies required to run the code.

Usage:
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/neural-network-binary-classification.git
Install the dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the training script: python train.py

Output:
The training script will output the training log loss and accuracy at each epoch, as well as the final training and testing log loss and accuracy.

Note:
This implementation assumes that the dataset is already preprocessed and split into training and testing sets.
The hyperparameters of the model can be tuned for better performance.
